THE SOFTWARE IS NOT PRODUCTION READY!

The following list below should not be considered Authoritative.  It is simply
a list of issues that the developers have noticed.  The software is Open Source
so you are free to modify the code.  Those modifications could result in issues
that compromise the software.  You should have a Qualified Engineer go over this
software as well as your changes before deployment.

As of Version 1-Initial the following is a list of known issues:

  *  The entire code base is an issue.  DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION IN ANY FORM!

     Resolution: This code is not meant for anything outside of testing how
     App Engine handles various frameworks.  This is *NOT* the BaseApp!  Just
     version 1 which should be looked at as more a "Hello World" than a
     serious application.  For example it uses `get` instead of `post` for
     storing data to the server, there isn't any validation, verification, or
     even error handling.  Result is wait for the real BaseApp or help by
     contributing to developing the real BaseApp!

This is only a list of known issues.  There could be other issues that have not
been discovered.
