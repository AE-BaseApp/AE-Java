[AE-Java](http://ae-java.appspot.com) - Java / JSP / Google App Engine Base App
==============================================

AE-Java BaseApp
---------------

[AE-BaseApp](http://ae-baseapp.appspot.com) is a multi-platform app-engine base-app created by 
Mark Finch to assist developers looking to build their first applications 
leveraging Google's Cloud Infrastructure. AE-Java is adapted from AE-Python
base app with significant portion of version 1 of the code adapted from App
Engine Guestbook Demo App.

The AE-Java version of Project-GAE uses the Java/JSP Language to provide a
simple application base to launch new Google App Engine Applications from.  

Features of version 1 include Ad-Sense integration, examples of how to use basic
templates, access the datastore to create and read.  The main goal of version 1
is to have a very simple application to benchmark various frameworks running on
App Engine.  The reason to keep it simple is to see how much a performance hit a
framework has on App-Engine.  AE-Java being the lightest of the Java based
baseapps will likely perform the fastest.  That is the question we hope is
answered with version 1 of AE-BaseApp.

Guestbook Demo App.

The GAE-Java-JSP version of Project-GAE uses the Java/JSP Language to provide 
a simple application base to launch new Google App Engine Applications from.

is to see how much a performance hit a framework has on App-Engine.
GAE-Java-JSP being the lightest of the Java based base apps will likely 
perform the faster than the others.  That is the question we hope is 
answered with version 1 of Project-GAE.

NOTE: Due to App Engine requirements version numbers will all be integers.
